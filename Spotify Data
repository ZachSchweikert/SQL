# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# I then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#I used SQL to ask the following questions I had of the data.


# How many times does each artist show up on this list?;

SELECT count(artist_name), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) desc;

# What are the 10 most popular song?;

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
Limit 10;

# What is the average duration of songs by Olivia Rodrigo?;

SELECT artist_name, AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
GROUP BY artist_name;

# What is the average tempo, danceability, energy, and loudness of song that have a popularity of 90 or higher?;

SELECT avg(tempo), avg(danceability), avg(energy), avg(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >89
